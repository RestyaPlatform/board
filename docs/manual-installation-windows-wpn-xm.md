# Manual installation in windows using wpn-xm

## Introduction

[Restyaboard](https://restya.com/board) is an open source alternative to Trello, but with smart additional features like offline sync, diff /revisions, nested comments, multiple view layouts, chat, and more. And since it is self-hosted, data, privacy, and IP security can be guaranteed.

Restyaboard is more like an electronic sticky note for organizing tasks and todos. Apart from this, it is ideal for Kanban, Agile, Gemba board and business process/workflow management. It can be extended with [productive plugins](https://restya.com/board/apps "productive plugins")

Today, several universities, automobile companies, government organizations, etc from across Europe take advantage of Restyaboard.

*   For Apache:
    *   `https://github.com/RestyaPlatform/board/blob/master/.htaccess#L7` Change `RewriteBase / to RewriteBase /your_local_folder/`

*   For nginx:
    *   `https://github.com/RestyaPlatform/board/blob/master/restyaboard.conf`Change root directory in nginx configuration also,
    *   `https://github.com/RestyaPlatform/board/blob/master/restyaboard.conf#L3` Change the server\_name to restyaboard.localhost
    *   `https://github.com/RestyaPlatform/board/blob/master/restyaboard.conf#L21` - Add your local folder name in rewrite rules

**Change your config file** `fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;` **to** `fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;`

    D:\server\bin\pgsql\bin>createuser -s -d -r postgres
    D:\server\bin\pgsql\bin>createdb -h localhost -U postgres restyaboard 
    D:\server\bin\pgsql\bin>psql -h localhost -U postgres

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE restyaboard TO restya;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO restya;  
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO restya;
    
    D:\server\bin\pgsql\bin>psql -h localhost -d restyaboard -U restya -W < d:\server\www\restyaboard\sql\restyaboard_with_empty_data.sql
