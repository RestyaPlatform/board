# Push Notifications

Depending on the notification functions and goals, push notifications are often displayed as a full screen or as a top or bottom banner.

Unlike SMS, which is used for conversational communication, push notifications are a type of marketing automation that is used to provide critical information in a unique and customized way to app users.

## Manage Push Notifications

For the Restyaboard mobile app, you can enable and disable the push notifications on the user’s profile settings page.
