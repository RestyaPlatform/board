| RESTYA_DB_USERNAME  | The desired restya db user which has access to the restya database.          |               |
| RESTYA_DB_USERPASS  | The restya db user password.                                                 |               |

| SMTP_PORT           | Port of the SMTP server.                                                     | `587`         |

#### Database

The docker container creates necessary restyaboard user and relations in postgres during startup.
Therefore it checks if the `RESTYA_DB` database already exists.
If it exists it skips the init step for database.

This means if you setup the database on your own you have also to make sure that all relations and users will be added.
