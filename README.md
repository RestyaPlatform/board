### What is Restyaboard?
Trello like kanban board. Tasks, to-dos, chat, etc., [Restyaboard](http://restya.com/board/) is based on [Restya platform](http://restya.com/) with dual License ([OSL 3.0](LICENSE.txt) & [Commercial License](http://restya.com/contact)).

Whether you’re creating a personal todo list, planning your holidays with some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary concept, Restyaboard is an simple and effective tool to keep your tasks organized. The boards of restyaboard will give you a visual overview of the current state of your projects, and make you productive by allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

### Why use Restyaboard?
Since Restyaboard is free software, you don’t have to give us your data and you can install the Restyaboard on your own internal server. You can also increase your productivity even more by reducing the time of managing the projects with the help of the Restyaboard plugin which is available in [RestyaPlatform](http://restya.com/board/apps).

| POSTGRES_ADMIN_USER | An admin user in postgres. (Needed for creating restya user and extensions.) |               |

| RESTYA_DB_USERNAME  | The desired restya db user which has access to the restya database.          |               |
| RESTYA_DB_USERPASS  | The restya db user password.                                                 |               |
| RESTYA_DB           | Name of the database for restya.                                             | `restyaboard` |
| SMTP_SERVER         | Address of the SMTP server.                                                  | `smtp_relay`  |
| SMTP_PORT           | Port of the SMTP server.                                                     | `587`         |

#### Database

The docker container creates necessary restyaboard user and relations in postgres during startup.
Therefore it checks if the `RESTYA_DB` database already exists.
If it exists it skips the init step for database.

This means if you setup the database on your own you have also to make sure that all relations and users will be added.
